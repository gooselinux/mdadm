%description 
The mdadm program is used to create, manage, and monitor Linux MD (software
RAID) devices.  As such, it provides similar functionality to the raidtools
package.  However, mdadm is a single program, and it can perform
almost all functions without a configuration file, though a configuration
file can be used to help with some common tasks.

%changelog
* Mon Mar 28 2011 Doug Ledford <dledford@redhat.com> - 3.2.1-1
- Update to latest upstream release
- Don't report mismatch counts on either raid1 or raid10 devices
- Check both active and idle arrays during raid check runs
- Move raid-check script to /usr/sbin, add a crontab entry to /etc/cron.d
  and mark it config(noreplace) so that users can select their own
  raid check frequency and it will be preserved across updates
- Allow the raid check script to set both the cpu and io priority on the
  raid check process in an effort to minimize the impact to users on the
  system

* Tue Mar 16 2010 Doug Ledford <dledford@redhat.com> - 3.1.2-1
- Grab latest upstream release instead of git repo snapshot (bz552344, bz572561)
- The lack of /dev/md is causing problems, so add code to mapfile.c to cause
  us to create /dev/md if it doesn't exist (bz569019)

  legitimate reasons why the count may not be 0 and we are getting enough
  false positives that it renders the check useless (bz554217, bz547128)

* Thu Feb 18 2010 Doug Ledford <dledford@redhat.com> - 3.1.1-0.gcd9a8b5.2

* Wed Feb 17 2010 Doug Ledford <dledford@redhat.com> - 3.1.1-0.gcd9a8b5.1

* Wed Nov 04 2009 Doug Ledford <dledford@redhat.com> - 3.0.3-1
- New upstream release 3.0.3 (bz523320, bz527281)
- Update a couple internal patches
- Drop a patch in that was in Neil's tree for 3.0.3 that we had pulled for
  immediate use to resolve a bug
- Drop the endian patch because it no longer applied cleanly and all attempts
  to reproduce the original problem as reported in bz510605 failed, even up
  to and including downloading the specific package that was reported as
  failing in that bug and trying to reproduce with it on both ppc and ppc64
  hardware and with both ppc and ppc64 versions on the 64bit hardware.
  Without a reproducer, it is impossible to determine if a rehashed patch
  to apply to this code would actually solve the problem, so remove the patch
  entirely since the original problem, as reported, was an easy to detect DOA
  issue where installing to a raid array was bound to fail on reboot and so
  we should be able to quickly and definitively tell if the problem resurfaces.
- Update the mdmonitor init script for LSB compliance (bz527957)
- Link from mdadm.static man page to mdadm man page (bz529314)
- Fix a problem in the raid-check script (bz523000)

* Tue May 19 2009 Doug Ledford <dledford@redhat.com> - 3.0-0.devel3.7
- Move the mdadm.map file from /dev/md/ to /dev/ so the installer doesn't
  need to precreate the /dev/md/ directory in order for incremental
  assembly to work

  during the weekly data scrubbing

  keep its name and when it doesn't

* Fri Mar 20 2009 Doug Ledford <dledford@redhat.com> - 3.0-0.devel3.4

* Fri Mar 20 2009 Doug Ledford <dledford@redhat.com> - 3.0-0.devel3.3
- Slightly tweak the udev rules to make sure we don't start arrays
  while running in rc.sysinit...leave array starting to it instead
- Modify mdadm to put its mapfile in /dev/md instead of /var/run/mdadm
  since at startup /var/run/mdadm is read-only by default and this
  breaks incremental assembly
- Change how mdadm decides to assemble incremental devices using their 
  preferred name or a random name to avoid possible conflicts when plugging
  a foreign array into a host

- Remove the new mdadm rules file from upstream as we already have this in
